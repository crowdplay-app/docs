## Managing Sessions

Every session card on your dashboard has a **3-dot menu** (⋮) with management options.

### End a Session

Ending a session marks it as inactive:
- Fans can no longer submit new song requests
- The "Now Playing" section is hidden
- The queue history (played/skipped songs) is preserved
- The session remains on your dashboard

### Restart a Session

You can restart an ended session to make it active again:
- Fans can submit new requests
- The existing queue remains intact
- The session goes back to "Active" state

### Delete a Session

Deleting a session permanently removes it:
- The session and all its queue data are erased from the database
- This frees up one slot toward your 20-session limit
- **This action cannot be undone**

<Warning>
  Deleting a session is permanent. Make sure you don't need the queue history before deleting.
</Warning>

## Session Dashboard View

When you click into a session, you see:

## Queue Display

Each song in the queue shows:
- **Song title and artist** with album artwork
- **Requested by** — the fan's nickname
- **Vote count** — displayed as a number (shows when > 0 votes)
- **Controls** — Play Next, Skip, Remove, Reorder (up/down arrows)
