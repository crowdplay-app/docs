## Scan the QR Code

The easiest way to join is to **scan the QR code** displayed by the DJ. This opens the CrowdPlay fan client directly in your phone's browser — no app download needed.

## Enter a Session Code

If you can't scan the QR code, you can manually enter the session code:

1. Go to [crowdplay-app.github.io/fan](https://crowdplay-app.github.io/fan/)
2. Enter the **6-character session code** shown by the DJ
3. Click **Join**

## Enter Your Nickname

After joining, you'll be asked for a **nickname**. This is how the DJ sees who requested each song. Pick something fun!

<Info>
  Your nickname is stored locally in your browser for the duration of the session. No account is required.

## What You Can Do

Once you've joined a session, you can:

- **Search for songs** using the Deezer-powered search bar
- **Request a song** by tapping on a search result
- **Upvote existing requests** — if a song is already in the queue, your request counts as a vote

## Session Ended?

If the DJ ends the session while you're connected:
- You'll see a **"Session has ended"** message
- No further requests can be made
- If the DJ restarts the session, refresh the page to rejoin
