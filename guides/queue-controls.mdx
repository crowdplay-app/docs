## Queue Actions

As a DJ, you have full control over the queue. All actions update in **real-time** for both you and connected fans.

### Play Next

Moves the top pending song to **Now Playing** status. The previous "Now Playing" song (if any) is marked as **played**.

- Only one song can be "Now Playing" at a time
- Click the **Play** button on any pending song to play it next

### Skip

Skips the currently playing song:
- The song is marked as **skipped** (⏭) in the history
- The next pending song automatically becomes "Now Playing"

### Remove

Removes a song from the queue entirely:
- The song disappears from the queue
- Positions of remaining songs are recalculated

### Reorder

Move songs up or down in the queue:
- Use the **↑** and **↓** arrow buttons on each queue item
- The queue order updates instantly for all connected clients

## Duplicate Detection & Voting

When a fan requests a song that's already in the queue:

1. Instead of adding a duplicate, the existing entry's **vote count** increases
2. The fan who requested it is added to the **voters** list
3. Each fan can only vote for a specific song **once**
4. If a fan tries to vote again, they see a "You already voted" message
5. Songs with more votes stand out with a visible vote badge

<Info>
  The vote count displayed is `duplicateCount + 1`, representing the original requester plus all additional voters.

## Real-Time Updates

All queue changes are broadcast via Socket.IO:

| Action | Socket Event |
|--------|-------------|
| Song requested | `queue-updated` |
| Play next | `queue-updated` + `now-playing` |
| Skip | `queue-updated` + `now-playing` |
| Remove | `queue-updated` |
| Reorder | `queue-updated` |
| End session | `session-ended` |

Both the DJ dashboard and fan clients receive these events and update their UI immediately.
