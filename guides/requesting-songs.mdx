## Searching for Songs

The fan client includes a search bar powered by the **Deezer API**:

1. Type a song title, artist name, or both
2. Results appear instantly as you type
3. Each result shows the **song title**, **artist**, and **album artwork**

## Submitting a Request

Tap on any search result to submit it to the DJ's queue:

- Your **nickname** is attached to the request
- The song appears in the DJ's queue immediately (real-time)
- You'll see a confirmation message

## Upvoting (Duplicate Requests)

If you request a song that's **already in the queue**:

- Your request counts as an **upvote** instead of a duplicate
- The vote count on that song increases
- Songs with more votes are more visible to the DJ

<Warning>
  You can only upvote a specific song **once** per session. If you try to vote again, you'll see a "You already voted for this song" message.
</Warning>

## How Votes Work

| Scenario | What Happens |
|----------|-------------|
| First request for a song | Song added to queue with 1 vote |
| Second person requests same song | Vote count becomes 2 |
| Same person requests again | Rejected — "already voted" message |
| Different song requested | New entry added to queue |

## Tips for Fans

- **Be specific** when searching — include the artist name for better results
- **Upvote songs** you want to hear instead of requesting duplicates
- **Check what's playing** — the DJ might already have your song queued
