## Your Dashboard

After logging in, you'll see your **dashboard** showing all your sessions. From here you can:

- **Create New Session** — start a new session for your event
- **View existing sessions** — click any session card to open it
- **Manage sessions** — use the 3-dot menu on each card to end, restart, or delete sessions

## Session Limits

Each DJ can create up to **20 sessions**. This includes both active and ended sessions. If you've reached the limit, delete old sessions to make room.

## Creating a Session

1. Click **Create New Session** on your dashboard
2. Enter a session name (e.g. "Saturday Night Live", "Beach Party")
3. The session is created with a unique **6-character code** and a **QR code**

## Sharing with Fans

Each session has a QR code that links fans directly to your session. You can:

- **Display the QR code** on a screen at your venue
- **Share the link** directly — the URL contains your session code
- The fan URL format is: `https://crowdplay-app.github.io/fan/?code=XXXXXX`
